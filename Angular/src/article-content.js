            'It’s 2024 already, and I am pretty sure we all know a couple of AI like the back of our hand. You and I have used ChatGPT or Bard or BeautifulAI to carry out tasks we were so lazy to do by ourselves. At times, you might have thanked anyone who invented AI over and over again, especially when you had just submitted that task you were assigned at 11:59 pm thanks to ChatGPT! \n' +
            'However, a question arises, Are we Safe from the very technology that is growing at a rapid pace, taking over the world? \n' ,
            'As of 2024, AI can write codes, build websites, generate beautiful images to given prompts, create your presentations, do your accounts,  give you legal advice or even create your own anime girlfriend who will tend to all your needs. So basically, AI is replacing whatever that humans have been doing or have been trying to perfect from centuries ago.\n' ,
            '\n' ,
            '“The real problem of humanity is the following. We have Palaeolithic Emotions, Medieval Institutions and Godlike Technology, And it is terrifically dangerous. It is now approaching a point of crisis overall”\n' +

            'The job market is already competitive. Thousands of undergraduates find it difficult to land a job in the current market. The last thing you want is to go to an interview, barely land a job and one month later “boom!”. You got replaced by an AI named “Rogers”. Guess what, “Rogers” can and will do your job far better than you originally did.\n' ,
            'Sounds ridiculous? Honestly, take your time to think about it.\n' ,
            'By 2030, 30% of the working hours in USA can be replaced by AI according to McKinsey analysis. It even suggests 300 million full time jobs can be lost due to AI replacement. Writers, Market Analysts, Legal jobs, Software Developers, Accountants all of these mark as in the risk category. Minimal Wage jobs are getting replaced by AI rapidly. \n' ,
            'The truth is, more repetitive your task is without much to process or think, with less specific skills there is a higher chance of your job getting replaced by AI in the near future. Sure, these jobs doesn’t seem to look grand in a bird’s eye view. However minimum wage jobs solves the problem of unemployment at any country in the world. When these jobs get replaced by AI it leads, to various socio economic issues. \n' +
            'Even when it comes to jobs like Software Engineering which is a highly skilled job position as of now, has a risk. The team of 8 IT professionals who needed to work on a task for months now can only need about 4 people, and an AI model. The task will be carried out within less time as well. \n' ,
            'However, there is a different font for this specific issue aroused by AI. First of all let us take a look at, “How AI works”. \n' ,
            'AI is self-evolving. It’s like teaching someone how to make bread and then they read a paratha recipe online and they make one themselves. Just like that, We provide AI with data and simple instructions at first. The large amounts of data provided to AI from various sources are then processed, it recognises patterns and in return it is able to give solutions to similar scenarios. AI compares the problems with similar issues and forms an answer. \n' +
            'Now let’s say, you took away the data. It can no longer consume data as it used to do. This way AI looses touch with the most recent and relevant information. Now it is unable to find patterns leading to inaccurate results. This is when “AI Hallucination” begins. It tries to connect dots and complete missing data sets, and tries to predict answers without solid patterns. This is called AI Hallucination. \n' +
            'One of the very famous examples for AI Hallucination so far is when Google’s Bard chatbot claimed world’s first images of a planet outside our solar system. Which was a result of inaccurate biased data leading to AI hallucination. \n' ,
            'What people do not understand is, these everyday repetitive jobs that people do, collect so much data in general. When these sorts of jobs completely gets replaced by AI, it also leads to inadequate and false positive data. Which eventually leads to AI Hallucinations.  \n' +
            'Job replacement is just one aspect of threats that is posed to humanity through AI. There are many risk factors regarding Transparency, Ethical values, Data privacy etc. \n' +
            'We are still at the very beginning of the era of AI. What we see today is just a sliver of what AI is capable of. The future holds so much potential, as well as risks to humanity.\n' +
            'Humans and technology has to go hand in hand. As one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the past decades Stephen Hawking quotes,\n' ,
            '“Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks”\n'

            '1.\tThe Nature\n' ,
            'Something, every Digital Nomad seeks for in common is the natural beauty which surrounds their destinations. Sri Lanka has this at abundance. Whether it is the chilly mountains in the central plains of Sri Lanka or the tropical beaches around the island you have so many options to choose from. \n' +
            'Arugam bay, Mirissa, Hikkaduwa,  Pigeon Island, Unawatuna all these beach destinations in the southern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka offers stunning beaches and opportunities to take a look at the divine marine life in the ocean. Surfing, rafting, diving all these adventures are close by at a very affordable rate.  \n' +

The mountains of Sri Lanka offers stunning views from the mountains and you can observe elephants natural behaviour leisurely. \n' ,

In 2021 Sri Lanka brought forth a law to issue a special Digital Nomad visa for foreigners. Though it has not yet been implemented, it is soon to be.

            'Sri Lanka has a rich heritage of 2500 years of history and a culture enriched with years of impact. As I mentioned above Sri Lankan people are known for their good hospitality. Culture, also consists of their food. One thing you will absolutely love about Sri Lanka is that it got any kind of food you need. Since it is a coastal country, Ceylon compasses of a huge seafood palate. You can access fresh seafood from anywhere in the country, especially the coastal towns. Sri Lankan food is inspired by South Asia and also heavily influenced by the western countries due to the colonisation in the late eighteen hundreds. \n' +

            'Sri Lanka went through major struggles in the recent years, which took a direct hit on their economy. Before covid 19 it already had a declining economy and in 2023 it turns out it has grown worse. Sri Lanka is going through its worst economic crisis in the past decade. High inflation rates, Negative GDP rates has costed Sri Lankan a great deal. The cost of living on the average citizen is very high as of now. According to the data from the Asian Development Bank Sri Lanka has a -3.0% of GDP( Gross Domestic Product) as of September 2023. Yet it has improved from the past year which had -7.1% of GDP.  Compared to other South Asian countries in 2023 Sri Lanka’s GDP falls very short compared to Maldives, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. The inflation rates stand at a whopping 18.7% in September 2023. The cost of food, utilities, transportation has gone higher ever since and today Sri Lankans stand at a lost state to afford all these expenses with an average monthly income of just US $200. \n' ,
            'Major Events leading to an economic crisis \n' ,
            'Sri Lanka was a country recovering from its 30 year long civil war which ended in 2009 in the past decade. Even before the Pandemic took over the country Sri Lankan economy was struggling. The government appointed in 2019 cut back on all taxes that it costed the Sri Lankan government a $1.4 bn of annual revenue. Growth percentage had slowed down, Investment rates were going down and there was huge amounts of debt to be paid. \n' ,
            'In 2020 when the Pandemic hit Sri Lanka. The country closed down all exports and imports. It had a major impact on Tourism. Which is a major income industry in Sri Lanka. Production and Manufacturing industries were shutting down with lack of investments and resources. Most of the resources were allocated towards the health system and towards the recovery process from Covid 19. This led to scarce of primary resources and access to services. The people were struggling with their day to day needs. One of the key symbols of the struggle was the long fuel lines seen across the country everywhere. After the 2 years of struggle with Covid 19 the country was again met with a major crisis cause of the political instability of the central government. \n' ,
            'Sri Lanka lost all access to its international financial markets in 2020. Sri Lanka had no income and was heavily relying on official reserves in the country. From 2019 to 2022 official reserves dropped down from US $7.6 billion to just $400 million. In 2022 Sri Lankan economy was contracted by 7.6%. Sri Lankan Rupee floated against the US dollar by 78% between March to May of 2022. The foreign assets went down to US $-4.8 billion by December 2022.  \n' ,
            'The scarcity of essentials such as fuel, medicines, food led to major crisis and the people of Sri Lanka protested for months on end to devote the current president. These events affected directly on the economy of Sri Lanka. \n' ,
            'Path to Recovery and Prospects \n' ,
            'Midst all the protests of the common people and political disputes, Sri Lanka was finally able to appoint a new president in place of the old one in July 2022. Sri Lanka has managed to improve its situation since then and this has paved way for improvement economically. The new government has been making its connections with IMF and other countries for a debt restructure. The IMF grant is supposed to be permitted by the end of this year, with hopes it will shed light on the country’s economy. According to the Asian Development Bank Sri Lanka’s GDP rate is supposed to rise up to 1.3% in 2024. Inflation rates forecasted for 2024 is 5.5%. While this is still low improvement. It has vastly improved compared to last year. Amidst all this the Sri Lankan rupee was appreciated again in 2023 March. What Sri Lanka needs is a debt restructuring program to pay back all the unsustainable debt it holds to the world bank and China. The IMF board has agreed for a US $ 2.9 billion fund facility program extending for over 48 months. Sri Lankan government is bonded to the IMF abide by its rules and regulations. \n' ,
            'Impact of the Economy\n' ,
            'For the past few years the Sri Lankan people has suffered due to many crisis situations. The working class being the most affected. Due to loss of jobs and slowing down in processes like manufacturing and production. Mostly they had to fall back to farming and other jobs to suffice. Socially and economically the burden befallen on people the past years is very high. The growth and poverty reduction percentage has slowed down immensely in the recent years. Poverty in Sri Lanka will stay in 25% of the population for many years to come according to data.\n' ,
            'Sri Lanka needs to regain its access to international markets, and improve its industries and service sectors. Create more jobs common people, without letting unemployment grow at a rapid scale. Debt restructuring is mandatory. Political stability also plays a key role here. The central government must hold responsible solid for Sri Lanka’s economy to flourish.  \n' ,
            'Sri Lanka went through its worst economical downfall in the last decade. It needs to recover and match up to the global context. The impact it had socially is massive, Sri Lanka needs to restore balance in its economy by all means. So far the new governments steps to recovery, partnering up with international funds and aid has given more hope to Sri Lankans. This will invite more investments towards the country, increasing in capital. Hopefully this will restore the normal lifestyle of Sri Lankans.\n'
